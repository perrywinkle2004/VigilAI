## 🧩 Adding Routes

To add new routes to the application, update the `Routes.jsx` file:

```jsx
import { useRoutes } from "react-router-dom";
import HomePage from "pages/HomePage";
import AboutPage from "pages/AboutPage";

const ProjectRoutes = () => {
  let element = useRoutes([
    { path: "/", element: <HomePage /> },
    { path: "/about", element: <AboutPage /> },
    // Add more routes as needed
  ]);

  return element;
};
```

## 🎨 Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration includes:

- Forms plugin for form styling
- Typography plugin for text styling
- Aspect ratio plugin for responsive elements

AI-Powered Compliance Guardian

AI-Powered Compliance Guardian is a cybersecurity-focused compliance framework that leverages Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs), and data-driven analytics to automate, monitor, and secure enterprise compliance operations. The system combines access control, data encryption, and risk analysis mechanisms to protect organizational assets while ensuring alignment with internal policies and external regulatory standards.

🚀 Overview

Modern enterprises generate massive amounts of data — from code repositories and communication platforms to contracts and workflows. Managing compliance and security across such diverse systems is challenging, especially when relying on manual audits and disjointed tools.
AI-Powered Compliance Guardian solves this by integrating AI intelligence with cybersecurity best practices to create a unified, automated compliance environment. The system ensures data integrity, detects non-compliance risks in real time, and maintains full transparency through explainable AI-driven insights.

🔐 Core Features

Access Control Management: Implements role-based and rule-based access control to prevent unauthorized data exposure and enforce compliance with privacy regulations.
Data Encryption & Protection: Utilizes encryption for data at rest and in transit, ensuring secure handling of sensitive information throughout the compliance process.
Risk Analysis Engine: Applies AI models to assess, prioritize, and predict potential compliance and security risks based on data patterns and activity logs.
AI-Powered Compliance Auditing: Continuously monitors documents, communications, and codebases to identify violations, missing clauses, or risky configurations.
Explainable AI (XAI): Every detection, recommendation, and decision is backed by interpretable reasoning for traceability and audit-readiness.
Automated Reporting: Generates real-time audit logs, compliance summaries, and risk dashboards for security and compliance officers.


🧩 System Architecture

AI Core: Fine-tuned LLMs analyze structured and unstructured data for compliance anomalies.
Access Control Layer: Integrates authentication and authorization systems to manage data visibility securely.
Encryption Module: Ensures cryptographic protection across data pipelines and storage environments.
Risk Assessment Module: Conducts continuous threat and compliance risk evaluations with prioritization scores.
Dashboard & Visualization: Offers real-time monitoring, insights, and remediation tracking through an intuitive UI.


🎯 Objectives

Automate compliance and risk detection through AI.
Secure enterprise data with encryption and controlled access.
Provide explainable, auditable, and continuous compliance insights.
Reduce manual effort while improving accuracy and accountability.


🧠 Future Enhancements

Integration with SIEM systems for advanced threat and compliance correlation.
Implementation of zero-trust security architecture.
Addition of machine learning–based anomaly detection for dynamic risk prediction.
Expansion of compliance mapping to frameworks like GDPR, ISO 27001, and SOC 2.
